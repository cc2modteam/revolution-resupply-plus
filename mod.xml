Allow the carrier to pick up cargo directly from islands without a barge!

If your carrier is within 2km of an island and you have placed an inventory order, transfer
cargo, weapons and fuel from the island to your carrier automatically.

Transfers are slightly slower than normal barge transfer but are automatic if you are in range.

Requires Revolution 1.4 and Tactical Operations Centre
Uses library_custom_2.lua
